            <h1>Mervyn the Rocking Horse</h1>

            <p>
                Mervyn the Rocking horse was named after Mervyn Peake, an illustrator and story teller famous for his Gormenghast series of novels.
                <img src="Images/RoomC/mervynPeake.jpg" />
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition to writing his own stories, Mervyn illustrated novels by Lewis Carrol, Quentin Crisp, Robert Louis Stevenson and Balzac.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exact reason why PL Travers named her Rocking Horse after him will never be known, but it is known that she kept this whimsical companion close for almost her entire life.

            <h1>Childhood Home</h1>

            <p>
                In PL Travers novels, the Banks’ live comfortably in a dilapidated house where it is made quite clear by the father that one may have either a nice house or four children, but not both.                
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picChildhoodHome.jpg" />
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a nod to the exigencies of life in these settings, that wealth and comfort are a sacrifice one may choose to make, or perhaps have no say in at all.

            <p>
                The iconic candy-pink door in the family home serves to remind us that whilst the exterior of our lives may simply be serviceable, the interior may well harbour the love, safety and care of family.

            <h1>Honorary Doctorate</h1>

            <p>
                P. L. Travers was a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965, Smith College in 1966 and the Claremont Colleges in California in 1970. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She was awarded a honorary doctorate from Chatham College in Pittsburgh and lived on a Navajo Indian reservation, studying myth and folklore.
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picChatham.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Travers was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours.                
            </p>

            <h1>Spirituality</h1>

            <p>
                PL Travers was a student of Zen philosophy, Buddhism and Hindu teachings … to name but a few of her interests.
            </p>
            <p>                
                She was particularly fond of Hanuman, a Hindu divinity known for his enthusiastic efforts to serve and bring joy into the world, inspiring her book Friend Monkey (1971).
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picHanuman.jpeg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                PL Travers believed that stories arose from the mysterious places of the soul, bubbling up into the conscious mind during the quiet moments of meditation and reflection.

            <h1>Typewriter</h1>

            <p>
                “Actresses grow old, dancers grow wobbly, whereas a writer still has a typewriter,” PL Travers.
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picAutoWriting.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                She believed that handwriting was a more direct connection to her subconscious, a form of automatic writing.

                <i>
                    “A Zen priest with whom I studied told me that Mary Poppins was full of Zen; that in every Zen story there is always a single object which contains a secret. 
                    Sometimes the secret is revealed, sometimes not. It doesn’t matter, but it is always present.”</i> PL Travers

            <h1>Childhood doll</h1>

            <p>
                PL Travers childhood doll is an example of the Dutch Doll tradition, where lathe-turned lengths of wood are held together by pegs and sold to children undressed.
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picDutchDoll.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                The owners of these dolls would then create the outfit for the doll themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this, the Dutch Doll resembled an Artist’s Mannequin and was actually used by PL Travers and Mary Shepherd in this role to create the iconic look and feel of Mary Poppins herself.
