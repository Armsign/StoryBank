                P. L. Travers was a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965, Smith College in 1966 and the Claremont Colleges in California in 1970. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She was awarded a <b class="blue">Honorary Doctorate from Chatham College</b> in Pittsburgh and lived on a Navajo Indian reservation, studying myth and folklore.

            </p>
            <p>
                Travers was appointed <b class="blue">Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)</b> in the 1977 New Year Honours.

                PL Travers was a student of <b class="blue">Zen philosophy, Buddhism and Hindu teachings</b> … to name but a few of her interests.
            </p>
            <p>                
                She was particularly fond of Hanuman, a Hindu divinity known for his enthusiastic efforts to serve and bring joy into the world, inspiring her book Friend Monkey (1971).

            <p>
                PL Travers believed that stories arose from the mysterious places of the soul, bubbling up into the conscious mind during the quiet moments of meditation and reflection.

                She believed that handwriting was a more direct connection to her subconscious, a form of automatic writing.

                Then she picked up a small <b class="blue">glass paperweight</b>. Not the one with the prisoned snowstorm that was used in the film, but a more modest dome with a house inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The legend on the globe read "<i>Home Sweet Home</i>".

            <p>
                "<i>Some day,</i>" Miss Travers said, "<i>I might write a story about this paperweight, because now-a-days, there are so few people, so few who have that sense of home, a safe place, eternal, hidden in their hearts.</i>"

            <h1>Childhood doll</h1>

            <p>
                PL Travers childhood doll is an example of the Dutch Doll tradition, where lathe-turned lengths of wood are held together by pegs and sold to children undressed.
                <img src="Images/RoomC/picDutchDoll.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>
                The owners of these dolls would then create the outfit for the doll themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this, the Dutch Doll resembled an Artist’s Mannequin and was actually used by PL Travers and Mary Shepherd in this role to create the iconic look and feel of Mary Poppins herself.
