                For many years, <b class="blue">Mervyn the Rocking Horse</b> resided in the entrance hall of her town-house, establishing an air of child-like whimsy the moment one walked through the front door.

            <p>
                No one really knows the exact reason why P.L. Travers chose the name Mervyn.

            <p>
                But we do know that she was close friends with Mervyn Peake, an author famous for his <i>Gormenghast</i> trilogy and illustrations he created for authors such as Lewis Carroll, Robert Louis Stevenson, Balzac and the Brothers Grimm.

                In her stories, P.L. Travers often personified things - the literary technique of giving human qualities to inanimate objects. For example, she believed her house in Chelsea to be sad and disconsolate until she moved in and created her own world inside.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                She famously painted the front door of <b class="blue">29 Shawfield Street</b> the pretty colour of cherry blossoms, the same colour used for the cover of <i>Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane</i>.

                Her Great Aunt Ellie once gave P.L. Travers a Royal Doulton bowl as a birthday gift.

                P.L. Travers was deeply interested in <b class="blue">Zen philosophy, Buddhism and Hindu teachings</b> and other spiritual influences.

            <p>                
                She believed that stories arose from the mysterious places of the soul, bubbling up into the conscious mind during the quiet moments of meditation and reflection.
